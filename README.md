# Express.js API, MCP Server, and Vue.js Client Noop Template

This repository contains a minimal foundation for an Express.js API, an MCP server and a Vue.js client. This application also utilizes Amazon DynamoDB for record storage and Amazon S3 for image upload storage.

The purpose of the repository is to act as a starting point for new application development on the Noop platform. To convert an existing application to use the Noop platform, [the guide on creating this template](https://noop.dev/blog/launch-nodejs-vue-monorepo/) can be used as a reference.

## Get Started

To create and run an instance of this template [install Workshop](https://noop.dev/docs/installation/) and select the "NodeJS Backend with Vue Frontend" template. The template creation process in Workshop will automate bootstrapping and running the application.

## Testing It Out

Once your application is deployed (locally in Workshop or in Cloud), visit the associated endpoint to interact with the example todo list app.

## Using with Claude Desktop

To use Claude Desktop to interface with the applications's MCP Server service component, add the following to your Claude Desktopâ€™s configuration file. This file will be located at either `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on Mac or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows. Please note, the URL listed below will need to be adjusted if your application is exposed at a different endpoint. Thereafter, you will need to open or restart Claude Desktop for the configuration changes to take effect.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "noop-todo-app-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://nodejs-vue-template-todo-app.local.noop.app/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
