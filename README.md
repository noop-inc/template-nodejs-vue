# Nodejs + Vue Monorepo Noop Template

This repository contains a minimal foundation for a Nodejs API backend with a Vue frontend organized as a monorepo. The complete application consists of the Nodejs API backend, Vue frontend, Amazon DynamoDB for record storage and Amazon S3 for image upload storage.

The purpose of the repository is to act as a starting point for new application development on the Noop platform. To convert an existing application to use the Noop platform, [the guide on creating this template](https://noop.dev/blog/launch-nodejs-vue-app) can be used as a reference.

## Get Started

To create and run an instance of this Template [install Workshop](https://noop.dev/docs/installation/) and select the Nodejs + Vue Template. The create-Template process in Workshop will automate bootstrapping and running the Application.

## Testing It Out

Once your Application is deployed (locally in Workshop or in Cloud), visit the associated endpoint to interact with the example todo list app.
